'''
Given an array of distinct integers and an integer representing the target sum, 
we are asked to implement a function that is going to find out whether 
there's a pair of numbers in the array that adds up to the target sum. 
If such pair exists, return the pair in any order; otherwise return an empty array. 
We cannot add a number to itself to get the target sum.
